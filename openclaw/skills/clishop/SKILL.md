# CLISHOP — Buy anything from your terminal

CLISHOP is an open-source MCP server and CLI that lets AI agents search for products across multiple stores, compare prices, and place real orders — all from the terminal.

**46 MCP tools** for the full shopping lifecycle: search → compare → buy → track → review → return.

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g clishop
```

Use the email-first setup command:

```bash
clishop setup start --email user@example.com --json
```

Then search products, and only add an address or payment method when the user is ready to buy.

### MCP Server

```bash
clishop-mcp              # If installed globally
npx -y clishop --mcp     # Without installing
```

All requests are sent over **HTTPS** to `https://clishop-backend.vercel.app/api`.

## Security & Privacy

- **Authentication:** Session tokens are stored in the OS keychain via [keytar](https://github.com/nicknisi/keytar), never in plain-text config files.
- **No local data collection:** CLISHOP does not collect analytics, telemetry, or tracking data locally.
- **Agent safety profiles:** Spending limits (`maxOrderAmount`), category allow/block lists, and confirmation requirements are enforced client-side before any order is placed.
- **Data sent to API:** Only the data required for each operation (search queries, addresses, order details) is sent to the CLISHOP backend API. No additional metadata is collected.
- **Vendor stores:** When extended search is enabled, the CLISHOP backend fans out search queries to registered vendor Dark Stores in real-time. Product data flows through the CLISHOP API — the CLI never contacts vendor stores directly.

## Trust Statement

By using this skill, your search queries, shipping addresses, payment method references, and order details are sent to the CLISHOP API (`clishop-backend.vercel.app`). The API acts as a gateway to registered vendor stores. No data is sold or shared with third parties beyond what is necessary to fulfill orders.

## Model Invocation Note

This skill is designed for autonomous invocation by AI agents via the Model Context Protocol (MCP). When an MCP client (e.g. Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code Copilot) calls these tools, the agent may search for products, place orders, and manage account data on the user's behalf — subject to the safety thresholds configured in the user's agent profile.
